# Migration Increments (Living Plan)

This document contains only the immediate, actively managed migration backlog.
It is intentionally not written in stone. As implementation progresses and we
learn more, this backlog should be split, merged, reordered, rewritten, and
pruned. The overall migration plan is located in
[`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).

## Increment Workflow Rules

### Coverage Baseline And Regression Rules

- For every increment, capture a coverage baseline **BEFORE** editing tracked
  files.
- If baseline capture is missed, recover it from a detached temporary worktree
  at `HEAD` under `tmp/agent/` instead of using `git stash` in the active
  working tree.
- Treat the baseline as the value captured from the branch state at increment
  start (or recovered from detached `HEAD` per policy), not from an earlier
  conversation snapshot.
- Do not infer or restate a baseline from memory; cite the exact command output
  captured for the current increment.
- If post-change coverage is lower than that baseline, keep the increment open
  until coverage is restored or the project owner explicitly approves the drop.
- Capture and report follow-up work for significant coverage decreases and other
  gaps in increment scope:
  1. if follow-up is a discrete task, create a new increment with clear scope
     and review target,
  2. if follow-up is open-ended, add inline TODO comments and consider adding a
     note in the next increment that references those TODOs.
- Do not add new uncovered code, or cause a coverage drop in code modified by
  the current increment, without explicit human approval.

### Completion And Evidence Gate

- Do not mark an increment complete while any Review target bullet remains
  partially implemented, deferred without agreement, or unverified.
- Do not remove an increment from this file or add its log entry until all of
  the following evidence exists in the same working pass:
  1. required wrapper checks executed (`tests`, `lint`, `build`, `format`,
     `coverage`, and `lint-md` when docs changed),
  2. command outputs show success exit codes,
  3. coverage baseline and post-change values are both reported.
- If scope changes mid-increment, rewrite the increment entry before claiming
  completion so the backlog reflects the real agreed scope.

### Backlog Hygiene

- Completed increments must be moved to [`MIGRATION-LOG.md`](./MIGRATION-LOG.md)
  and removed from this file so the backlog stays forward-looking.

## Documentation

Make sure to understand the project by reading appropriate sections of the
following documents before starting work on an increment:

- [Architecture & design decisions](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Agent instructions](./AGENTS.md)

## Design Decisions

Architectural and design decisions referenced by active increments:

- [Two-stage planning model](./ARCHITECTURE.md#two-stage-planning-model)
- [Library and CLI parity](./ARCHITECTURE.md#library-and-cli-parity)
- [Output boundary: domain data vs CLI rendering](./ARCHITECTURE.md#output-boundary-domain-data-vs-cli-rendering)

## Current Backlog

### Increment 69: Continue coverage recovery after apply-path branch tests

Why this increment exists:

- Follow-up coverage increments have raised total line coverage to 99.71%, but
  remaining live-path gaps in `rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/actions.rs`, and
  region-only gaps in `rust/src/status.rs` still keep the broader recovery work
  open.

Review target:

- Improve total line coverage above the current 99.71% baseline without
  changing delivered runtime behavior.
- Prefer unit tests over integration tests while closing the remaining
  uncovered paths in `rust/src/lib.rs` and the highest-value residual live
  branches in `rust/src/actions.rs`.
- Treat region-only gaps in `rust/src/status.rs` and `rust/src/app/apply.rs`
  as lower priority unless they become the cheapest remaining wins.
- Keep parsing concerns in `rust/src/cli.rs` and composition-root wiring in
  `rust/src/lib.rs`.
- Run required wrappers (`tests`, `lint`, `build`, `format`, `coverage`, and
  `lint-md` when docs change) and report fresh timestamp evidence.
