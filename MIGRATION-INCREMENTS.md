# Migration Increments (Living Plan)

This document contains only the immediate, actively managed migration backlog.

It is intentionally not written in stone. As implementation progresses and we
learn more, this backlog should be split, merged, reordered, rewritten, and
pruned.

Completed increments must be moved to [`MIGRATION-LOG.md`](./MIGRATION-LOG.md)
and removed from this file so it stays forward-looking.

Capture and report follow-up work to address significant coverage decreases and
other gaps in the increment scope. If the follow-up is a discrete task, create
a new increment with a clear scope and review target. If the follow-up is more
open-ended, add inline TODO comments in the relevant code and consider adding a
note in the next increment that explicitly references the TODOs to ensure they
are not forgotten. Treat a drop of about 0.25 percentage points or more as
significant unless there is a stronger project-specific reason.

## Design Decisions

Architectural and design decisions referenced by active increments:

- [Two-stage planning model](./ARCHITECTURE.md#two-stage-planning-model)
- [Library and CLI parity](./ARCHITECTURE.md#library-and-cli-parity)
- [Output boundary: domain data vs CLI rendering](./ARCHITECTURE.md#output-boundary-domain-data-vs-cli-rendering)

## Current Backlog

### Increment 8: Support per-config-item option overrides

Why this increment exists:

- Current planning applies global defaults uniformly to all config items.
- Users need item-level overrides for mode and destination behavior without
  duplicating sources.

Review target:

- File/select config items can override relevant default execution options.
- Planning resolves item-level overrides deterministically.
- Shared resolved-option fields are factored into one reusable plan type to
  reduce duplication across planned action variants.

### Increment 9: Inspect one narrow symlink status case

Why this increment exists:

- Introduce the first real filesystem behavior with tightly constrained scope.
- Start with read-only inspection before write-side apply behavior.

Review target:

- A single symlink status workflow works against temporary directories.
- Status results are returned as structured data, not terminal output.

### Increment 10: Wire the default CLI inspection flow

Why this increment exists:

- Deliver the first thin end-to-end vertical slice through config, planning,
  inspection, and rendering.
- Confirm the CLI is acting as an adapter over library behavior.

Review target:

- The default CLI path loads config, inspects status, and renders output.
- CLI tests cover observable output and exit behavior.
