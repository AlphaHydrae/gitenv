# Migration Increments (Living Plan)

This document contains only the immediate, actively managed migration backlog.
It is intentionally not written in stone. As implementation progresses and we
learn more, this backlog should be split, merged, reordered, rewritten, and
pruned. The overall migration plan is located in
[`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).

Completed increments must be moved to [`MIGRATION-LOG.md`](./MIGRATION-LOG.md)
and removed from this file so it stays forward-looking.

Capture and report follow-up work to address significant coverage decreases and
other gaps in the increment scope. If the follow-up is a discrete task, create
a new increment with a clear scope and review target. If the follow-up is more
open-ended, add inline TODO comments in the relevant code and consider adding a
note in the next increment that explicitly references the TODOs to ensure they
are not forgotten. Treat a drop of about 0.25 percentage points or more as
significant unless there is a stronger project-specific reason.

## Documentation

Make sure to understand the project by reading appropriate sections of the
following documents before starting work on an increment:

- [Architecture & design decisions](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Agent instructions](./AGENTS.md)

## Design Decisions

Architectural and design decisions referenced by active increments:

- [Two-stage planning model](./ARCHITECTURE.md#two-stage-planning-model)
- [Library and CLI parity](./ARCHITECTURE.md#library-and-cli-parity)
- [Output boundary: domain data vs CLI rendering](./ARCHITECTURE.md#output-boundary-domain-data-vs-cli-rendering)

## Current Backlog

<!-- Empty - all planned increments are complete. See MIGRATION-LOG.md for what has been completed. -->
