# Migration Increments (Living Plan)

This document contains only the immediate, actively managed migration backlog.
It is intentionally not written in stone. As implementation progresses and we
learn more, this backlog should be split, merged, reordered, rewritten, and
pruned. The overall migration plan is located in
[`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).

## Increment Workflow Rules

### Coverage Regression Rules

- Run coverage checks for increments that change code.
- If post-change coverage is lower than 100%, keep the increment open until
  coverage is restored or the project owner explicitly approves the drop.
- Capture and report follow-up work for significant coverage decreases and other
  gaps in increment scope:
  1. if follow-up is a discrete task, create a new increment with clear scope
     and review target,
  2. if follow-up is open-ended, add inline TODO comments and consider adding a
     note in the next increment that references those TODOs.
- Do not add new uncovered code, or cause a coverage drop in code modified by
  the current increment, without explicit human approval.

### Completion And Evidence Gate

- Do not mark an increment complete while any Review target bullet remains
  partially implemented, deferred without agreement, or unverified.
- Do not remove an increment from this file or add its log entry until all of
  the following evidence exists in the same working pass:
  1. required wrapper checks executed (`tests`, `lint`, `build`, `format`,
     `coverage`, and `lint-md` when docs changed),
  2. command outputs show success exit codes,
  3. coverage output confirms the coverage target is still met.
- If scope changes mid-increment, rewrite the increment entry before claiming
  completion so the backlog reflects the real agreed scope.

### Backlog Hygiene

- Completed increments must be moved to [`MIGRATION-LOG.md`](./MIGRATION-LOG.md)
  and removed from this file so the backlog stays forward-looking.

## Documentation

Make sure to understand the project by reading appropriate sections of the
following documents before starting work on an increment:

- [Architecture & design decisions](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Agent instructions](./AGENTS.md)

## Design Decisions

Architectural and design decisions referenced by active increments:

- [Two-stage planning model](./ARCHITECTURE.md#two-stage-planning-model)
- [Library and CLI parity](./ARCHITECTURE.md#library-and-cli-parity)
- [Output boundary: domain data vs CLI rendering](./ARCHITECTURE.md#output-boundary-domain-data-vs-cli-rendering)

## Current Backlog

(Empty - all README documentation feature parity work is now complete.)

**Coverage impact:** New test expectations added to existing test infrastructure;
coverage should remain at 100% function/line/region.
