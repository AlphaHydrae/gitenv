# Migration Increments (Living Plan)

This document contains only the immediate, actively managed migration backlog.
It is intentionally not written in stone. As implementation progresses and we
learn more, this backlog should be split, merged, reordered, rewritten, and
pruned. The overall migration plan is located in
[`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).

## Increment Workflow Rules

### Coverage Baseline And Regression Rules

- For every increment, capture a coverage baseline **BEFORE** editing tracked
  files.
- If baseline capture is missed, recover it from a detached temporary worktree
  at `HEAD` under `tmp/agent/` instead of using `git stash` in the active
  working tree.
- Treat the baseline as the value captured from the branch state at increment
  start (or recovered from detached `HEAD` per policy), not from an earlier
  conversation snapshot.
- Do not infer or restate a baseline from memory; cite the exact command output
  captured for the current increment.
- If post-change coverage is lower than that baseline, keep the increment open
  until coverage is restored or the project owner explicitly approves the drop.
- Capture and report follow-up work for significant coverage decreases and other
  gaps in increment scope:
  1. if follow-up is a discrete task, create a new increment with clear scope
     and review target,
  2. if follow-up is open-ended, add inline TODO comments and consider adding a
     note in the next increment that references those TODOs.
- Do not add new uncovered code, or cause a coverage drop in code modified by
  the current increment, without explicit human approval.

### Completion And Evidence Gate

- Do not mark an increment complete while any Review target bullet remains
  partially implemented, deferred without agreement, or unverified.
- Do not remove an increment from this file or add its log entry until all of
  the following evidence exists in the same working pass:
  1. required wrapper checks executed (`tests`, `lint`, `build`, `format`,
     `coverage`, and `lint-md` when docs changed),
  2. command outputs show success exit codes,
  3. coverage baseline and post-change values are both reported.
- If scope changes mid-increment, rewrite the increment entry before claiming
  completion so the backlog reflects the real agreed scope.

### Backlog Hygiene

- Completed increments must be moved to [`MIGRATION-LOG.md`](./MIGRATION-LOG.md)
  and removed from this file so the backlog stays forward-looking.

## Documentation

Make sure to understand the project by reading appropriate sections of the
following documents before starting work on an increment:

- [Architecture & design decisions](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Agent instructions](./AGENTS.md)

## Design Decisions

Architectural and design decisions referenced by active increments:

- [Two-stage planning model](./ARCHITECTURE.md#two-stage-planning-model)
- [Library and CLI parity](./ARCHITECTURE.md#library-and-cli-parity)
- [Output boundary: domain data vs CLI rendering](./ARCHITECTURE.md#output-boundary-domain-data-vs-cli-rendering)

## Current Backlog

### Increment 62b: Finish the work

Why this increment exists:

- The implement of the existing_directories_only flag raised two issues that
  must be fixed.

Review target:

- There must be a configuration parsing test that proves the flag is correctly
  parsed from YAML when true.
- Configuration parsing must validate that the flag cannot be set to true unless
  the recursive flag is also true, and that an appropriate error is returned if
  this validation fails.

### Increment 63: Make `select.exclude` use glob patterns

Why this increment exists:

- Recursive selection is most useful with path-aware filtering. Moving from
  exact-name exclusion to glob patterns enables practical recursive workflows
  without adding includes yet.

Review target:

- Replace exact-string exclusion checks with glob-pattern matching for
  `select.exclude`.
- Match recursive candidates using source-relative paths (for example
  `**/*.tmp`, `private/**`, `**/.DS_Store`).
- Keep deterministic behavior and define stable precedence between selector
  type filtering and glob excludes.
- Add unit tests for representative glob cases in both direct and recursive
  modes.
- Add one integration test validating glob excludes in recursive apply output.
- Preferred library: `globset` (widely used in Rust tooling, deterministic,
  supports `**` and efficient compiled pattern sets).
